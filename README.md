# Errors in first-principle atomistic simulations

This repository attempts to establish a common language and community guidelines
about discussing and tracking errors in first-principle atomistic simulations.
Particular emphasis is the simulation pipeline from a DFT-based data generation,
to the fitting of interatomic potentials and onwards employing the resulting potentials
in molecular-dynamics simulations leading to a theoretical description of dynamic properties.

This repository has been started as part of the CECAM workshop
[Error control in first-principle modelling](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1115).
Everyone is welcome to open issues, pull requests or otherwise contribute.

## TODO / How can I help?
- Provide a discussion of errors and error sources in your standard simulation pipeline
  and add it as a markdown file to this repository. Try to use the language and definitions
  specified in [Overview.md](Overview.md).
- Discuss examples for good or bad error analysis practices

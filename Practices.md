# Best practices of error control

* Are any error bars good (even if they are not necessarily meaningful) ?
    * Yes to impose cultural change?
* How to impose cultural change that error bars should be included ?
    * Emphasise need for error analysis in reviewing activity
    * Proposals/papers should require an "error analysis" or an "error analysis statement"
      similar to requiring a data availability statement.
* Who can provide error control measures ?
   * Package developers (should this be mandatory?)
   * Users (maybe not -> don't have the time/expertise to do this)
